‚úîÔ∏è Projects: 
- Academic Projects: 
  - Web Services and Service Oriented Architecture:
    - Parse, store, manage, and analyze the service data retrieved from ProgrammableWeb.
      - Design the data structure for MongoDB database, parse the text files and load the data to the
database. Using this database as the backend, develop a web-based query system that allows the following query:
        - Return the names of APIs based on different criteria, including updated year,
protocols, category, rating (such as higher than, equal to, or lower than a given
rating), and tags.
        - Return the names of Mashups based on different criteria, including updated year,
used APIs, and tags.
        - Given a set of keywords, return the names of APIs if all the keywords can be found
in the title, summary, or the description of the APIs.
        - Given a set of keywords, return the names of Mashups if all the keywords can be
found in the title, summary, or the description of the Mashups.

      - Cartoon filter for instagram.
      - Dice counting program involving unclear images.
    - Worked on a term project using 2240 images of Cotton field cultivation using **Deep Learning** techniques to classify them under 4 types of irrigation. 
    - Code for all the above can be found under my github repos: [Link here](https://github.com/ashwathhalemane/CSCI-631-Computer-Vision)

- Personal Projects:
  - MEAN stack projects including a front-end blogging application in **Angular** can be found [here](https://github.com/ashwathhalemane/Angular-7-Blog-App-).  
  - The backend API corresponding to the aforementioned frontend is available [here](https://github.com/ashwathhalemane/REST-API-Blog-app). Within this project, I've incorporated **Snyk** and **SonarCloud** to identify application security concerns, simulating how security vulnerabilities can emerge in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). As part of this effort, I addressed two minor vulnerabilities: Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection. This was achieved by implementing measures such as sanitizing user input using the `escapeHTML` function and ensuring proper data handling by converting `req.params.blogId` to a string before utilizing it in a database query. Commit can be found [here](https://github.com/ashwathhalemane/REST-API-Blog-app/commit/b3f3e5f6b93fa26087ccb23d4f31b043371a92ca).   
  - You can find some of my exploration in the realm of **Cybersecurity** [here](https://github.com/ashwathhalemane/hacking-exercise), where I've engaged with diverse Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, hacking challenges from platforms like HackTheBox, CTFlearn, rootme and developed custom tools tailored for these challenges.
  - In the past, I was involved in developing an **Android application** for a friend's college business, serving as an online catalog. You can explore it [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tattooswag.ashwath.newtattooswag).
